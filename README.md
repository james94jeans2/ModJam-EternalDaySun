ModJam-EternalDaySun
====================
EternalDaySun Mod for Minecraft 1.4.7
Adds a block that skips the night and stops rain, as soon as it apears.
It adds circuits crafted with redstone and iron ingots.
An item called Time Machine, crafted with gold ingots, two circuits and a clock.
And last but not least an item called Weather Machine crafted with a nether star, circuits and gold ingots.
Because of it's power the EternalDaySun block has a crafting recipe using the time machine and the weather machine, which include a nether star. The block includes 6 iron blocks and a block of diamond too.
This is my first mod, that's visible in minecraft and I know that my textures look terrible, because I really cannot draw. However I have created another mod before, called "Minimapsync" synchronizing waypoints from various minimaps with the server, so that people can share their waypoints if they want and the mod does not have to be installed on the client to join the server and viceversa. Also I started programming on this mod right today, so it was a bit late, because I had some difficulties with github (first time working with it).
